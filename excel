This can be anything from poorly written algorithms, a lack of
understanding about the way Python works, use of incorrect or
inefficient data structures, doing network accesses or other
unpredictable work at import time, etc.  The bottom line I think is that
you have to measure what you've got in production, and attack the
hotspots.  For example, I love and can't wait to use Python 3.7's `-X
importtime` flag to measure regressions in CLI start up times due to
unfortunate things appearing in module globals.
